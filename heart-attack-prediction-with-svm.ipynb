The workflow includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), outlier treatment, and various visualizations such as scatter plots and heatmaps. Feature engineering with mutual information is applied to identify relevant features, followed by model training with standard scaling in a pipeline. Hyperparameter tuning improves the model's accuracy from 78% to 90% on the testing set, showcasing effective techniques in data preprocessing and model optimization. \n","The dataset used was collected from [Zheen hospital in Erbil, Iraq](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/wmhctcrt5v/1) and was accessed via [Heart Attack Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sukhmandeepsinghbrar/heart-attack-dataset). The features in the dataset to determine the risk of heart attack include Age, Gender, Heart Rate, Systolic Blood Pressure, Diastolic Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, CK-MB, and Troponin.

We started with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), identifying outliers and performing data visualizations such as scatter plots and heatmaps to understand the dataset. After engineering relevant features using mutual information, we trained the model with standard scaling and optimized it through hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, increasing accuracy from 78% to 90%. Finally, we exported the optimized model in the ONNX.js format, enabling seamless deployment and real-time predictions directly within a web application without the need for a backend server."]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"gpu","dataSources":[{"datasetId":4696069,"sourceId":7979222,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30822,"isGpuEnabled":true,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.12"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":569.006608,"end_time":"2025-01-16T09:09:47.342599","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2025-01-16T09:00:18.335991","version":"2.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
